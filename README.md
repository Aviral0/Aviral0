# Thanks for stopping by, I'm Aviral Jain 👋

I'm a backend python developer focused on building reliable, scalable, and efficient systems. I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean, maintainable code and thoughtful design.

I have been working for ~3 years in [cactus communications](https://cactusglobal.com) as a Senior Software Engineer. 
I build features for [paperpal.com](https://paperpal.com/homev3), all the features you see on RHS panel are genai features build by yours truly

## 🧩 Who Am I?

Tired of engineers who just turn Jira tickets into code — no questions asked, no context understood?  
Or those who freeze up when a group of PMs asks, *"So... why did we build this?"*

Well, your search ends here.

I'm an engineer with an MBA — the rare kind who’s scaled businesses (1 → X) in both offline and online worlds, and then made a deliberate pivot to follow my passion: building products (0 → 1) with real impact.

My business background means I don’t just understand the *what* — I get the *why*. I speak product just as fluently as I speak code.  
I connect strategy to systems and translate business requirements into clean, scalable, maintainable features — no hand-holding required.

In short: I know how to talk to humans *and* computers.

## 🧑‍💻 Areas of Interest


- ⚙️ **Building clean, scalable, efficient APIs**  
  If your codebase gives a migraine to the next developer, you have not done a fair job. 

- 🔍 **Code reviews & sprint planning**  
  My MBA degree has taught me find tasks that delivers the maximum impact - sometimes of all things, refactoring the bloated codebase delivers the max impacc

- ✅ **Keeping test cases up to date**  
  Tests aren't optional — they're the confidence check before shipping to production.

- 🧠 **Building LLM-based features**  
  Cactus uses a wrapper built by me, to safely manage and route LLM calls — no direct API key exposure. You want to call an LLM? You call us. We "know a guy who knows a guy."

- 🚀 **Optimizing APIs**  
  Latency improvement is every developers hell, but it is probably the most staifying work you can do, asyncio for the win

- 🧱 **System design & architecture**  
  I believe in designing systems with clear structure — and yes, design diagrams don’t lie. They reveal what’s missing before it's too late.

- ☁️ **Cloud technologies**  
  Comfortable working with AWS and container-based deployments. Infrastructure as code (IaC) is second nature with Terraform.
